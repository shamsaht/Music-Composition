# Music Composition using Python

This project explores the synthesis of music using Python, with a focus on recreating melodies programmatically. The core objective is to mimic parts of **"The Lonely Shepherd"** by Gheorghe Zamfir using sinusoidal waveform synthesis and note-based construction.

## Project Objectives

- Recreate musical compositions using code.
- Synthesize notes based on frequency and duration.
- Combine basic audio signals to form full melodies.
- Learn how sound waves and musical scales can be represented in code.

## Key Concepts

- **Sine Wave Generation**: Sound synthesis using sine waves.
- **Sampling & Frequencies**: Notes are mapped to specific frequencies and durations.
- **Waveform Composition**: Small segments are constructed and combined to form full songs.
- **Amplitude Modulation**: Used to create a natural feel in playback.

## Project Structure

- `Music_Composition.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with all code and explanation.
- `createNote()`: Custom function used to generate sine waves for each note.
- `compose_melody()`: Function to string together musical notes into a full piece.

## Sample Features

- Recreates a segment of “The Lonely Shepherd.”
- Code is modular and can be used to generate your own melodies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
